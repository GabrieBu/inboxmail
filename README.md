# Inbox Project

## Project Goals

The **Inbox Project** is designed to implement a simple inbox system allowing users to:

- Send, receive, reply to, and forward messages within a networked environment.
- Facilitate client-server communication for message exchanges using sockets.
- Support concurrent connections, enabling multiple users to interact with the inbox system simultaneously.

> **Note**: The majority of the planned features are not implemented yet; this README outlines the project’s scope and goals.

## Features (Planned)

- **Client-Server Communication**: The system will use socket programming to facilitate message exchange between clients and a server.
- **Inbox Functionalities**: Users will have access to standard inbox operations:
  - Sending and receiving emails.
  - Replying to and forwarding received messages.
- **Concurrent Programming**: Multithreading will be implemented to manage multiple client connections efficiently, allowing real-time interaction and updates.

## Technologies

- **JavaFX**: For building a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Java Sockets**: To handle client-server communication for messaging functions.
- **Java Concurrency**: For managing concurrent threads and ensuring thread-safe access to shared resources, enabling smooth operation across multiple clients.

## Current Status

As of now, the core functionalities—such as email composition and inbox interaction—are being developed. Client-server communication, concurrency, and socket integration are upcoming implementations.
